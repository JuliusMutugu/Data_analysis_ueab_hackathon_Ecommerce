## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process using 
Here i used **excel** to ensure the data is ready for Exploratory Data Analysis by following the outlined guide:
Tool used [Excel 2019](www.microsoft.com/office/2019)

### 1.  Handling Missing Values
- **Age Column**: Filled missing values using the **median** to avoid decimal issues.
- **Region Column**: Filled missing values with the most frequent region (**West**) used a count function to determine the common value.
- **Shipping Status Column**: Replaced missing values with **"unknown"** since the missing values are more than 10% for much effective visualization.

### 2Ô∏è. Ensuring Data Consistency
- **Unit Price**: Rounded to **2 decimal places** for uniformity.
- **Shipping Status**: Standardized text formatting and removed extra spaces

### 3. Excel pivot table for more insights about the data 
Here i used **pivot table** to better understand the data before progressing any further

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Group sales by product and get top 10
top_products = sales_dataframe.groupby("Product Name")["Total Price"].sum().nlargest(10)

# Plot bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
top_products.plot(kind="bar", color="royalblue", edgecolor="black")

# Customize labels and title
plt.xlabel("Product Name")
plt.ylabel("Total Sales")
plt.title("Top 10 Best-Selling Products")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)  
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.7)
