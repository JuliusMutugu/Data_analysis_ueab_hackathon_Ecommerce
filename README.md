## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process
**Tool Used:** [Excel 2019](www.microsoft.com/office/2019)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values
- **Age Column**: Filled missing values using the **median** to avoid decimal inconsistencies.  
- **Region Column**: Replaced missing values with the most frequent region (**West**), identified using a count function.  
- **Shipping Status Column**: Assigned missing values as **"unknown"**, since they accounted for more than **10%** of the dataset, ensuring effective visualization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Data Consistency
- **Unit Price**: Rounded to **two decimal places** for uniformity.  
- **Shipping Status**: Standardized text formatting and removed extra spaces.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Data Exploration using Excel Pivot Tables
To gain preliminary insights, a **Pivot Table** was used before proceeding with in-depth analysis.

## Sql Analysis

### Database Setup  
The dataset was imported into MySQL, and the necessary transformations were performed.  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Ecommerce;
USE Ecommerce;
```
### Data Preprocessing 
```sql
  UPDATE sales
  SET `Order Date` = CASE  
      WHEN `Order Date` LIKE '%/%' THEN date_format(str_to_date(`Order Date`, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%Y/%m/%d')  
      ELSE NULL  
  END;
  
  ALTER TABLE sales MODIFY COLUMN `Order Date` DATE;
```
### Important Queries 
#### best sales date of the week
```sql
  SELECT DAYNAME(`Order Date`) AS Day_of_Week,  
         SUM(`Total Price`) AS Total_Sales  
  FROM sales  
  GROUP BY Day_of_Week  
  ORDER BY FIELD(Day_of_Week, 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday');
```
#### top 5 customers
```sql
  SELECT `Customer ID`, SUM(`Total Price`) AS Total_Spent  
FROM sales  
GROUP BY `Customer ID`  
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC  
LIMIT 5;
```
#### highest revenue regions
```sql
