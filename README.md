## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process using 
Here i used **excel** to ensure the data is ready for Exploratory Data Analysis by following the outlined guide:
Tool used [Excel 2019](www.microsoft.com/office/2019)

### 1.  Handling Missing Values
- **Age Column**: Filled missing values using the **median** to avoid decimal issues.
- **Region Column**: Filled missing values with the most frequent region (**West**) used a count function to determine the common value.
- **Shipping Status Column**: Replaced missing values with **"unknown"** since the missing values are more than 10% for much effective visualization.

### 2Ô∏è. Ensuring Data Consistency
- **Unit Price**: Rounded to **2 decimal places** for uniformity.
- **Shipping Status**: Standardized text formatting and removed extra spaces

### 3. Excel pivot table for more insights about the data 
Here i used **pivot table** to better understand the data before progressing any further
